## Java MySQL Interactive GUI

This project allows for a connection to happen between the GUI and a MySQL database running locally. Can easily be adjusted to work with any database by providing new URL and valid credentials.

The GUI allows for SQL commands to be inputted which will in turn execute those command in the respective database.

Should handle any valid SQL command and should respect valid database priviledges

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
